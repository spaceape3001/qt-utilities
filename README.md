# Your Quill External Dependencies

***This is now a dead repository, the dependencies have been moved away.***

This repository is for managing the external/third-party dependencies for the your-quill suite of software.  The preference is to use submodules where possible.  However, if necessary, code may be imported & stored here so long as it's an open-source compatible license.
